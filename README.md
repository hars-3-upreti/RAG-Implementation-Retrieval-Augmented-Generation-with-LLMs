🚀 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Implementation
📌 Overview

This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that combines information retrieval with large language models (LLMs) to provide more accurate, grounded, and context-aware responses.

Instead of relying solely on an LLM’s internal knowledge, this system retrieves relevant documents from an external knowledge base (e.g., PDFs, websites, or custom datasets), and augments the LLM’s input with that context before generating answers.

This approach reduces hallucinations and ensures responses are factual, explainable, and domain-specific.

✨ Key Features

🔍 Document Retrieval: Retrieves relevant passages using vector similarity search.

🧠 Context-Aware Responses: Augments LLM prompts with retrieved knowledge.

📑 Multi-Source Support: Works with PDFs, text, and websites.

⚡ Modular Design: Easily replace embedding models, vector stores, or LLM backends.

📂 Persistence: Stores embeddings and metadata for efficient re-use.

🖥️ End-to-End Workflow: From ingestion → retrieval → generation → evaluation.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python 3.9+

LangChain / LlamaIndex (if used)

SentenceTransformers / OpenAI Embeddings (for vectorization)

FAISS / Chroma (for vector storage)

PyTorch / Transformers (for LLM inference)

pdfkit & wkhtmltopdf (for saving website content as PDFs, see test.py)

🚀 Usage
1. Run the RAG Notebook

Open chat_model.ipynb in Jupyter or VS Code and run all cells.
This will:

Load documents from Data/

Build embeddings and store them in vector DB

Accept user queries and generate answers with context

🔧 Customization

Change Embedding Model: Update in the notebook (e.g., use all-MiniLM-L6-v2 or OpenAI embeddings).

Switch Vector Store: Replace FAISS with Chroma, Pinecone, or Weaviate.

Swap LLMs: Use OpenAI GPT, HuggingFace Transformers, or a local LLaMA/Mistral model.

Add Data Sources: Extend ingestion to CSVs, SQL databases, or APIs.

📊 Future Improvements

✅ Add support for multi-turn conversations with memory

✅ Integrate re-ranking for better retrieval quality

✅ Build a Streamlit/Gradio web UI

✅ Add evaluation metrics (faithfulness, factuality, retrieval recall)

✅ Deploy as a REST API with FastAPI
